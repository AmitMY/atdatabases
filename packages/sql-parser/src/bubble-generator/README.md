# Bubble Generator Data

This is the data used to generate the diagarams for SQLite's documentation. It is in the public domain. I downloaded it from https://www.sqlite.org/docsrc/artifact/3a02e2677d405fbd and it can be found in the art/syntax/bubble-generator-data.tcl file in the documentation source code.
